# reddit-giveaway
A CLI for running effective Reddit giveaways using Puppeteer

Takes 4 non-abstracted inputs:
1. URL of Reddit post
2. String being searched for
3. Whether or not capitalization should be ignored
4. The number of winners

Currently #3 does nothing. I may revisit if it proves useful for me to do so, otherwise feel free to branch and make that simple change for your own use.

Outputs:
Comma-separated usernames of the winners
